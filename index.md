## Part Two

**DR. JOHN WOOD** to: **GRUPPENSEHER 2**

_________________________________

Gruppenseher 2,

As you know, the deadline is approaching. I need you to move out of your trial runs and begin with your first iterations of the Stage 2 procedure in the next week or two. Performance and metrics in your division have been lackluster to say the least, you better hope you produce some results soon.

Don't make me look like an idiot. Gruppenseher 3 and 4 have already moved into Stage 3, get your fucking act together.
And lack of funding isn't an excuse of failure!

- John Wood, M.D.
